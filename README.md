No-show-appointments is a dataset containing information about more than 110k medical appointments in Brazil.
The dataset is inside the folder named "Database_No_show_appointments".

The project is about asking five questions in order to know what are the variables that affect the patient's ability to show up for the appointment.  
The project is written in a single jupyter notebook named "Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb" that contains explanation and Python code with proper comments.  
The notebook has four sections Introduction, Data Wrangling, Exploratory data analysis and Conclusion.  
Each section is clearly explained and each code block is properly commented in the jupyter notebook.
